✅ 1. HTTP Methods

You used:

POST

Gateway → sends data to your API using
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/data

Used whenever a device or client wants to send new data.

GET

Dashboard → reads data from
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard

Used for retrieving information.

These are the 2 most important HTTP methods, and you already used both correctly.

✅ 2. HTTP Endpoints (Routes / URLs)

You created two endpoints:

/data → For receiving JSON

/dashboard → For showing latest readings

This means you understood:

✔ How APIs expose URLs
✔ How clients call them
✔ How data flows over HTTP routes

✅ 3. HTTP Request Body

You sent JSON in the request body:

{
  "gateway_id": "GW-001",
  "meters": [...],
  "timestamp": "..."
}


This is the most common format for IoT and web APIs.

You saw how Python receives it:

data = await request.json()


This is core to every API ever built.

✅ 4. HTTP Status Codes

You saw:

200 OK


Which means:

Request was successful

The API accepted the data

You also saw that errors appear as other codes (400, 500, etc.)

This is important for debugging IoT systems.

✅ 5. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

You learned that:

Browsers block HTTP requests from local HTML pages unless allowed

You enabled CORS with:

allow_origins=["*"]


This is a critical real-world concept in:

✔ Web development
✔ Dashboards
✔ IoT portals

And you fixed a real problem using CORS.

✅ 6. HTTP Client vs Server

You now understand:

✔ Gateway = HTTP client

Sends POST requests

Has a URL to submit data to

Does not store anything locally

✔ API = HTTP server

Listens for requests

Processes them

Sends responses

This is the essence of all web systems.

✅ 7. JSON Serialization

You converted Python objects → JSON:

requests.post(..., json=payload)


This is called serialization, essential for data exchange over HTTP.

✅ 8. Response Objects

Your server responded with:

return {"status": "ok"}


Which the gateway received as JSON automatically.

You now understand:

✔ request → process → response
✔ server returns structured data
✔ client reads it







| Concept          | Meaning                | You Used It           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| HTTP client      | device sending request | gateway_simulator.py  |
| HTTP server      | API receiving requests | api_server.py         |
| POST             | send data              | /data                 |
| GET              | fetch data             | /dashboard            |
| Request body     | JSON payload           | meters, gateway_id    |
| Response         | server reply           | {"status":"ok"}       |
| Status codes     | 200 OK                 | success prints        |
| CORS             | browser security       | fixed dashboard issue |
| Routes/Endpoints | API paths              | /data, /dashboard     |
| Serialization    | Python → JSON → Python | gateway + API         |
